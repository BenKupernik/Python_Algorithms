Recursive Algorithm Fun

This is just some fun algorithms I wrote for a python class. This program has 5 total functions. The function in order of appearance count how many substrings in a string start with the same character, how many charters there are in a string, finds the maximum and minimum vales of an array, prints a pattern of * and $ based of a number, and multiplies two positive integers together. They all use recursion to do this. After the function definitions is a short program that will ask the user for some information and run through each of the functions to demonstrate them.
